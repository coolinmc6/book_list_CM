# README

## Introduction
This repo is based off of Stephen Grider's [Modern React and Redux](#) course from Udemy.
The app was built using the create-react-app CLI and its purpose is to run through a basic
Redux example and learn how to build a project with Redux.

## Set-up
- These are the basic steps I followed to build the app:

```sh
create-react-app book_list_CM
npm install --save redux
npm install --save react-redux
# it was recommended that I insall redux tools; I did not for this example.
# That command is: npm install --save-dev redux-devtools
```
- I should now be all set and able to follow along with the lectures.  In my dependencies, 
I do not have:
  - lodash
  - react-router
- if I have problems later, I will install them...
